\section{Task 4}

The following aspects should be considered when rating the result of any given move.
\\\textbf{build phase rating function:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item number of own tiles, weighted by stability\textit{(sorted from best to worst)}: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item stable tiles: tiles that can not be captured by the opponent at all
			\item semi-stable tiles: tiles that can be captured by the opponent, but not immediately in the next move/hard to capture in general) 
			\item unstable tiles: tiles that can be captured by the opponent in the next move
			\item high risk tiles: tiles that can be captured by the opponent in the next move and give them stable tiles
		\end{itemize}
	\item number of bombs captured in that move * effectiveness of bombs\textit{(=number of tiles a bomb hits)}
	\item number of own possible moves (maximize as far as possible)
	\item number of each opponents' possible moves (minimize as far as possible)
	\item minimized tile loss of player=((own playerindex) - (overall capturable inversion stones))
	\item number of available override stones (more valuable the closer it is to the end of the game/the less the opponents have left)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{bomb phase rating function}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item number of own tiles
	\item difference to the other players' number of tiles
\end{itemize}
